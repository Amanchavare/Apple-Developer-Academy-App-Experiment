# 📱 Developer Academy App  
_An app for the students, by the students._

## 🎯 Objective  
To help students at the Apple Developer Academy feel more comfortable in the Academy space, connect with others easily, and form better, balanced teams for challenges.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
When new students join the Academy, they often face challenges such as:
- Difficulty in navigating the building (e.g., finding the Seminar Hall, classrooms).
- Trouble forming balanced teams due to lack of visibility into other students’ backgrounds, skills, or interests.
- Limited initial interaction with fellow students, making collaboration harder.

---

## ✅ Solution  
We created the **Developer Academy App** to address these pain points:

### 🗺️ Indoor Map  
An interactive, AR-powered map of the Academy to help students easily locate rooms and key areas.

### 👤 Student Profiles  
Each student has a profile in the app that includes:
- Name  
- Skills (developer, designer, etc.)  
- Nationality  
- Gender  

This promotes diversity and balance when forming teams.

### 🔍 ID QR Code Integration  
Each student’s ID card features a QR code. Scanning it within the app brings up their profile instantly—enabling quicker connections and team building.
